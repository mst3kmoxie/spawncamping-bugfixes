import java.util.Calendar;
This is based on the question Project 2.1 of the Java Concepts book (pp 21-22).  
    Items to resolve, beyond a basic understanding of the Calendar utility are:
    Write a program that prints the following information --
      1.  The date and weekday that is 100 days from today.
      2.  The weekday of your birthday.
      3.  The date that is 10,000 days from your birthday

=======================================
import java.util.GregorianCalendar;

public class CalendarApp {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//This is how you call TODAY'S date:
		GregorianCalendar cal = new GregorianCalendar(); 
		
		//This is how you call a SPECIFIC date:
		GregorianCalendar eckertsBday = new GregorianCalendar(1919, Calendar.APRIL, 9);
		
		//To change from today's date to another date you want, 
		//call the .add method.  Here we want 10 days from today's date:
		cal.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 10); 
		
		int dayOfMonth = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH);
		int month = cal.get(Calendar.MONTH);
		int year = cal.get(Calendar.YEAR);
		int weekday = cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_WEEK);
			// 1 is Sunday, 2 is Monday,...7 is Saturday
		
		cal.set(year, month, dayOfMonth);
		System.out.println("Date: " + cal.getTime().toString());
		cal.add(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH, 100);
		System.out.println("Date: " + cal.getTime().toString());
	}
}
